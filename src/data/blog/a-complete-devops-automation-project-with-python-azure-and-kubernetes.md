When preparing for interviews or building a serious DevOps portfolio, toy projects won't cut it. You need something that mirrors real-world complexity — and shows you know how to automate, integrate, and deploy across cloud and container platforms.

That's what I set out to build — and I'm excited to share my open-source [**DevOps Python Automation Project**](https://github.com/arnabdey73/devops-python-automation-project), a hands-on repo that brings together:

🧩 Python scripting  
☁️ Azure infrastructure (Bicep + Terraform)  
🛠️ GitHub Actions CI/CD  
🐳 Kubernetes deployment via Helm  
📊 Monitoring integrations (coming soon with Prometheus/Grafana)

## Why I Built This

With 14+ years in IT (8+ in DevOps), I've worked with pipelines of all sizes — from legacy monoliths to cloud-native microservices. I wanted to:

* Build a **comprehensive, job-ready portfolio project**
* Practice integrating tools that I've used professionally
* Share something reusable and explainable for the community

## What the Project Covers

### Python Automation

Python is the backbone of this project, used to:

* Manage infrastructure workflows
* Automate repetitive DevOps tasks
* Set up the groundwork for observability tools

### Infrastructure as Code: Bicep + Terraform

The project provisions Azure infrastructure using:

* **Terraform** for flexible, cloud-agnostic provisioning
* **Bicep** for Azure-native, cleaner IaC modules

You'll see how to modularize, version, and structure IaC the right way.

### CI/CD with GitHub Actions

The CI/CD pipeline handles:

* Infrastructure validation and deployment
* Docker builds
* Kubernetes app deployment
* Future additions: integration tests, notification hooks

### Kubernetes + Helm

The Kubernetes manifests are managed through **Helm**, which makes deploying and upgrading apps seamless and version-controlled.

## Who Should Check This Out

This project is a great starting point if you are:

* A **DevOps or SRE engineer** looking to sharpen automation skills
* A **Python developer** aiming to break into cloud or platform engineering
* A **student or job seeker** who needs an end-to-end project for interviews

## GitHub Repo

🔗 [arnabdey73/devops-python-automation-project](https://github.com/arnabdey73/devops-python-automation-project)

The repo is fully open-source and includes:

* Modular Python scripts
* IaC templates (Bicep + Terraform)
* Helm charts for Kubernetes deployment
* GitHub Actions CI/CD workflows
* A clear roadmap for future upgrades

## What's Next?

Planned features:

* 📊 Prometheus + Grafana for monitoring
* 💰 Azure cost visibility
* 📦 Secrets and config management
